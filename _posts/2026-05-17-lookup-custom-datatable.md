The standard lightning-datatable is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations—most notably the lack of support for Lookup inputs within cells. To provide a better UX for inline editing, we must extend the base component.

This post covers how to implement a custom datatable that supports specialized column types.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Lookup Field Support:** Enables seamless inline editing with a native-looking **Record Picker** for searching and selecting records.
* **Reusable Architecture:** Extends the standard `LightningDatatable` while maintaining all original functionalities.

## 1. Core Implementation: CustomDatatable.js

To add new types, we define customTypes in our JavaScript file. This tells the datatable which template to render for specific type attributes.

```javascript
import LightningDatatable from 'lightning/datatable';
import lookupTemplate from './lookupTemplate.html';
import lookupEditTemplate from './lookupEditTemplate.html';

export default class CustomDatatable extends LightningDatatable {
    static customTypes = {
        lookup: {
            template: lookupTemplate,      
            editTemplate: lookupEditTemplate,
            standardCellLayout: true,
            typeAttributes: ['value', 'objectApiName', 'name', 'label', 'context', 'fieldName'] 
        }
    };
}
```
