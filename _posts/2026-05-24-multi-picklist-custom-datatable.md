The standard lightning-datatable is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations—most notably the lack of support for Multi Picklist inputs. To provide a better UX for inline editing, we must extend the base component.

This post covers how to implement a custom datatable that supports specialized column types.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-picklist Field Support:** Enables seamless inline editing with a native-looking **lightning-combobox** for searching and selecting records.
* **Reusable Architecture:** Extends the standard `LightningDatatable` while maintaining all original functionalities.


## 0. Implementation Reference

Refer to the previously implemented codebase to maintain consistency in field mapping and event handling.
